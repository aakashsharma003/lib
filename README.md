# Library - Collaborative Learning Platform

> **Note:** The Transcript module is currently experiencing some errors; therefore, I am attaching a video that may not serve as the best example for demonstrating our features. Additionally, the "Ask" feature has been temporarily resolved with a workaround, so I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, as it might not work for some videos in the live link.

A platform built to make learning easy and collaborative. With Library, users get filtered YouTube content for better understanding, real-time doubt-solving, and quick revision tools‚Äîall in one place.
